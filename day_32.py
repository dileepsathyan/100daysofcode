#### Three different learning styles in ML algorithms.

### 1. Supervised Learning:

# ----- This involves training data and a known result for the variables to initially train the model.
# ----- A model is prepared through a training process which is required to do predictions. It will be corrected when it does wrong outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy using the training data
# ----- Examples: Classification & Regression models.


### 2. Unsupervised Learning:




### Semi-supervised Learning
