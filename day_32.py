#### Three different learning styles in ML algorithms.


### 1. SUPERVISED LEARNING:

# ---- This involves training data and a known result for the variables to initially train the model.
# ---- A model is prepared through a training process which is required to do predictions. It will be corrected when it does wrong outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy using the training data
# ---- Examples: Classification & Regression models.
# ---- Example algorithms include: Logistic Regression and the Back Propagation Neural Network.


### 2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING:

# ---- This doesnt invlove the data with labelled or known results.
# ----

### SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING:
