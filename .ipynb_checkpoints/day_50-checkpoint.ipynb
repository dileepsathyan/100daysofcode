    "### Most of the models assume that the observed data comes from a stationary process (constant mean and variance)\n",
    "### However, the data from a business (be it sales revenue or customers) evolve over time, hence making it non-stationary and may include seasonality depending on the nature of the business. Using non-stationary time series data in the models, result in concluding high R-Squared values between 2 variables which are not at all related but only changes over time.\n",

    "### When data mean and variance are time variant:\n",
    "#### * Observations come from different distributions over time, posing difficult problems for empirical modeling.\n",
    "#### * If not accounted for, it can result in serious statistical mistakes.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### * Economic evolution, legislative changes, technological changes, political turmoil etc\n",
