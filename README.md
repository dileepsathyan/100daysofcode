# Learn to code confidently in 100 consecutive days...

# MY TARGETS
I want to be able faster, competitive and confident in coding by which I mean,
    1. Improve my computational thinking & critical thinking skills
    2. Improve confidence in handling different IDE (PyCharm / VS code / Atom etc)
    3. Improve my Github profile activities
    4. Build confidence among my colleagues about my personal coding skills.
    5. Create a community in LinkedIn using the coding results updates.
