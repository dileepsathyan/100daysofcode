#### Three different learning styles in ML algorithms.


### 1. SUPERVISED LEARNING:

# ---- This involves training data and a known result for the variables to initially train the model.
# ---- A model is prepared through a training process which is required to do predictions. It will be corrected when it does wrong outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy using the training data
# ---- Examples: Classification & Regression models.
# ---- Example algorithms include: Logistic Regression and the Back Propagation Neural Network.


### 2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING:

# ---- This doesnt invlove the data with labelled or known results.
# ---- The model is prepared by deducing structures present in the input data to extract general rules.
# ---- Example: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, & Association Rule Mining 
# ---- Example algorithms include: K-Means & Apriori algorithm.


### 3. SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING:

# ---- In this case, the input data will be a mixture of labelled and unlabelled results.
# ---- Here the model is expected to learn the structures in the data and make desired predictions.
# ---- Examples: Classification & Regression models.



# Knowing which algorithm exists for a business problem is crucual in machine learning. ML algorithms can be grouped in different ways. However, I find it useful to group them by the learning styles.

#### 1. REGRESSION ALGORITHMS:

# ---- Regression is all about modelling the relationship among the variables that iteratively refined by a a measure of error in predictions made by the model. The most popular regression algorithms are:
# ------- a. Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR)
# ------- b. Linear Regression
# ------- c. Logistic Regression
# ------- d. Stepwise Regression
# ------- e. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
# ------- f. Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS)


### 2. REGULARIZATION ALGORITHMS

# ---- This is an extention made to above Regression algoriths.
# ---- These are modifications made to other algorithms. The examples are:
# ------- a. Ridge Regression
# ------- b. Least Absolute Shrinkage & Selection Operator (LASSO)
# ------- c. Elastic Net
# ------- d. Least Angle Regression (LARS)


### 3. INSTANCE-BASED ALGORITHMS (MEMORY BASED LEARNING):

# ---- Instance based learning model is a decision problem with instances or examples of training data that are deemed important or required to the model.
# ---- Such methods usually build up a database of example data & compare new data to the database using similarity measures in order to find the best match and make the prediction. Hence this is also called Memory based learning.
# ---- The most popular regression algorithms are:
# ------- a. k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
# ------- b. Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)
# ------- c. Self Organizing Map (SOM)
# ------- d. Locally Weighted Learning (LWL)
# ------- e. Support Vector Machines (SVM)




### 4. DECISION TREE ALGORITHMS

# ---- Decision Tree methods constructs a model of decision made based on actual values of attributes in the data.
# ---- Decisions fork-in tree structures until a prediction decision is made for a given record. Decision tree methods are often fast and accurate. The most popular algorithms are:
# ------- a. Classification & Regression Tree (CART)
# ------- b. Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3)
# ------- c. C4.5 and C5.0 (different versions of a powerful approach)
# ------- d. Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)
# ------- e. Decision Stump
# ------- f. M5
# ------- g. Conditional Decision Trees


### 5. BAYESIAN ALGORITHMS

# ---- These explicitly apply Baye's theorem on classification and regression problems.
# ---- The most popular algorithms are: 
# ------- a. Naive Bayes
# ------- b. Gaussian Naive Bayes
# ------- c. Multinomial Naive Bayes
# ------- d. Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE)
# ------- e. Bayesian Belief Network (BBN)
# ------- f. Bayesian Network (BN)
