# LOGISTIC REGRESSION

# Classification is an area of supervised machine learning that tries to predict which class or category some entity belongs to, based on its features

# The features or variables can take one of two forms:

# 1. Independent variables, also called inputs or predictors, donâ€™t depend on other features of interest (or at least for the purpose of the analysis).
# 2. Dependent variables, also called outputs or responses, depend on the independent variables.
