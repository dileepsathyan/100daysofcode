#### Three different learning styles in ML algorithms.


### 1. SUPERVISED LEARNING:

# ---- This involves training data and a known result for the variables to initially train the model.
# ---- A model is prepared through a training process which is required to do predictions. It will be corrected when it does wrong outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy using the training data
# ---- Examples: Classification & Regression models.
# ---- Example algorithms include: Logistic Regression and the Back Propagation Neural Network.


### 2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING:

# ---- This doesnt invlove the data with labelled or known results.
# ---- The model is prepared by deducing structures present in the input data to extract general rules.
# ---- Example: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, & Association Rule Mining 
# ---- Example algorithms include: K-Means & Apriori algorithm.


### 3. SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING:

# ---- In this case, the input data will be a mixture of labelled and unlabelled results.
# ---- Here the model is expected to learn the structures in the data and make desired predictions.
# ---- Examples: Classification & Regression models.



# Knowing which algorithm exists for a business problem is crucual in machine learning. ML algorithms can be grouped in different ways. However, I find it useful to group them by the learning styles.
